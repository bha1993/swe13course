===========

assignment1: learning node.js

assignment3: basic js and html/css stuff

assignment4: learning bootstrap

assignment6: learned how to use external features/tools

Not a very good course but learned a few things. Next steps may be to check out Jetstrap, which may be particularly useful as I explore the product manager route.

Finished at HackSC Fall 2014.
